# PMs Transcripts

The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet provides transcripts of more than [20,000 speeches, media releases, and interviews](https://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/about-collection) by Australian Prime Ministers. These transcripts can be [searched online](https://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/), and the underlying XML files [can be downloaded](https://pmtranscripts.dpmc.gov.au/developers) using a simple API.

I've created [a repository](https://github.com/wragge/pm-transcripts) containing all the XML files, a CSV-formatted index, and aggregated text and zip files for each prime minister.

This repository includes Jupyter notebooks for harvesting, indexing, analysing, and aggregating all the transcripts.

Run the notebooks in this repository live on MyBinder â€” just click the button (it might take a little while to load).
